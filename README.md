# Nintendo 64 KiCad schematic project

This is an unfinished KiCad schematic project of the Nintendo 64 motherboard.

So far, my focus has been on creating the schematic symbols for the various chips and components used.

Pull requests are not welcome at the moment as I don't have the bandwidth to handle them. This is a side project that I will work on at my own pace.
